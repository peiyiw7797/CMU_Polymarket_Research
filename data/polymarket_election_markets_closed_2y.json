Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the top two candidates receives by the sum of all votes cast in Polish Presidential Election runoff.\n\nIf the reported value falls exactly between two brackets, then this market will resolve to the higher range bracket.\n\nThis market will resolve based on the official vote count once the votes count has been made official.\n\nIf a recount is initiated before the vote total has been made official, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is made official.\n\nIf the results of the election aren\u2019t known by December 31, 2025 ET, or if the runoff is permanently canceled, this market will resolve to \u201cOther\u201d.  \n\nThis market will resolve based on the official results of the election, as reported by a consensus of credible reporting.

Final-round vote shares will be calculated by dividing each of the final two candidates\u2019 vote totals by the combined total of their votes in that round.\n\nIf the reported value falls exactly between two brackets, this market will resolve to the higher range bracket.\n\nIf all listed candidates ate eliminated before the final round of RCV tabulation or do not receive the most votes in the final round, this market will resolve to \"Other\".\n\nThis market will resolve based on the official certified results of the final RCV round as published by the New York City Board of Elections.\n\nIf a recount is initiated prior to certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and results are certified. A recount initiated after certification will not affect market resolution.",
